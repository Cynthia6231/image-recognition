# image-recognition

# This project implements a geometric shape recognition model capable of identifying simple, singular shapes, including rectangles, triangles, straight lines, and circles. 
# The model leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ResNet-50 architecture, and the Softmax function for accurate classification.
